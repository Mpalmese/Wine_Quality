Dataset: 
wineQualityReds.csv 

The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). 



In this project, we used the dataset and machine learning techniques to see what chemical properties in red wine produces a higher quality wine. We created an analysis of existing data to classify the wines as good or bad and are now able to predict the quality of a wine based on its chemical properties.
